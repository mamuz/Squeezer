Sometimes too expensive for production.\r\nUsing a minified file reduces the execution time of your application but increases the memory usage.\r\nTake care which directories or packages you want to squeeze. For production you should only squeeze\r\nused packages.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Minify classes, interfaces and traits to one compressed file.\r\n- Validates availability of class dependencies.\r\n- Removing comments and docblocks is optional to keep interoperability to annotation parser.\r\n- PHP files with more than one class, interface or trait declarations will be skipped.\r\n- PHP files with `include`, `include_once`, `require` or `require_once` statements will be skipped.\r\n- PHP files with function calls to handle files like `fopen` or `mkdir`will be skipped.\r\n- PHP files with a `declare` statement will be skipped.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
